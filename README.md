# ZackHandwriting

## Handwriting of Youtuber Mr. Zack Freedman.
Due to my obsession with Mr. Zack Freedman's handwriting that radiates nerdy vibes I wanted a way to use it in my personal projects as well as day to day life. But my human form cannot change my silly handwriting into something like his, *easily*. So I decided to make a font to be used in all word editors like MS Word, Google Docs and whatever Apple users use. Also I decided to make it in a way that it could be used in web development too.
     
This repository holds all the files I have extracted from Zack's discord server using this technique :

<br>Luckily Zack had made sticker's for all capital alphabets, digits and one or two special characters. This made things way more easier for me. Thanks Zack. And then I converted them into SVG files using free online converters.

Then I waited for affirmation of the man himself, asking for permission to do this which he kindly did.

# Files 
All the stickers that I have extracted (in PNG format) and their SVG format twins. It includes :
    <br> 1. English Capital Letters (PNG & SVG formats)
    <br> 2. Digits 0-9 (PNG & SVG formats)
    <br> 3. Void Star Labs Logo (PNG & SVG formats)
    
    
### Note -
All you need is SVG format images for any kind of use as their quality remains same for all dimensions. But I have kept the original PNG ones too as they require some extra processing work which I will explain more in the dedicated font repository which will hold the font file (.ttf format folder).
The actual folder will be added their which you could commit that you need to download and install in your system in order to use it in your system or websites.
